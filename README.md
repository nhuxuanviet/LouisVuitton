# LouisVuitton Clothing & Accessories Management System
# Project Overview
LouisVuitton is a web-based clothing and accessories sales platform developed using JSP and Servlet technologies. The system supports key functions such as product browsing, user registration, shopping cart management, order placement, and internal user role management (Admin, Manager, Customer). Designed for scalability and maintainability, it provides a structured solution for managing an online retail operation without online payment integration.

Admin Role:
System configuration, user role assignment, permission control, and high-level data overview.

Order Processing:
